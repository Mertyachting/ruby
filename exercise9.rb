  #Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

  #days store all days in a week
  days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
  #months store all months till August
  months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

  #prints the days
  puts "Here are the days: #{days}"
  #prints the months
  puts "Here are the months: #{months}"

  #prints a weird quote in 4 lines
  puts %{
There's something going on here.
With this weird quote
We'll be able to type as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
}
